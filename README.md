# FNB App Academy - README

Welcome to the FNB App Academy project repository! This document outlines the progress and activities completed from Week 1 to Week 9.

## Week 1: Introduction to HTML
- Learned the basics of HTML structure and syntax.
- Created simple web pages using headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.

## Week 2: HTML & CSS
- Enhanced HTML pages with CSS for styling.
- Explored selectors, properties, and values.
- Applied layouts, colors, fonts, and spacing to web pages.

## Week 3: Pine City Zoo App
- Built a full-featured Pine City Zoo web application.
- Created multiple HTML pages for animal exhibits (elephants, giraffes, koalas, monkeys, pandas, lions, gemsbok, gorillas, warthogs) with detailed information and images.
- Developed place pages for zoo attractions (amphitheatre, insect house, monkey trail, coffee shop, lost forest, Mo's Pizza, Dine @The Zoo) with descriptions and locations.
- Designed a weather page showing current and forecasted weather at the zoo.
- Added a feedback form and confirmation page for visitor input.
- Implemented a navigation system with top and bottom tabs for easy access to animals, places, map, weather, and feedback.
- Applied a custom CSS theme for consistent styling and layout across all pages.

## Week 4: JavaScript Fundamentals
- Practiced variable scope and global/local variables in JavaScript.
- Created and used functions, including parameterized and event-driven functions.
- Explored string and number manipulation, including type conversion and validation.
- Built interactive UI elements using JavaScript (e.g., weather advice with switch statements).
- Implemented a simple password checker and a mini login form project with user feedback.
- Developed a home page and additional practice files for JavaScript basics.

## Week 5: Calculator Project
- Designed and implemented a fully functional calculator app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Supported basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Added decimal support and input validation.
- Styled the calculator to resemble the Apple calculator, with circular buttons and a modern dark theme.
- Made the calculator responsive and ensured it fills the entire browser viewport (100vh).

## Week 6: Contact Book App
- Started building a Contact Book web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Implemented API key authentication and local storage for secure access.
- Fetched and displayed contacts from a remote API, including avatar images styled as circles.
- Added features to refresh and add new contacts.
- Used modular JavaScript (with config.js) for configuration and API management.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Created `add-contact.html` with a form for First Name, Last Name, Mobile, Email, and Profile Image (avatar upload).
- Ensured all form fields use correct `type` and `name` attributes for backend compatibility.
- Used JavaScript to collect form data with `FormData`, including file uploads.
- Added client-side validation to restrict image uploads to 2MB or less.
- Submitted new contacts to the backend via a POST request and handled success/failure feedback.
- Updated `home-page.html` to display all contacts in a table, showing avatar, first name, and last name.
- Enabled clicking a contact row to open the edit page for that contact.
- Created `edit-contact.html` to view, edit, and delete contacts:
   - Fetched contact details by ID and populated the form.
   - Provided an Edit button to enable form fields and allow updating contact info and avatar.
   - Provided a Delete button to remove the contact after confirmation.
- Ensured all navigation between pages works smoothly.
- Improved error handling and user feedback throughout the app.

## Week 7: Introduction to Python
- Learned the fundamentals of Python syntax and programming concepts.
- Practiced with variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), and basic operators.
- Implemented control flow using `if-elif-else` statements for decision-making.
- Used `input()` for user interaction and `print()` for displaying output.

## Week 8: Python Data Structures & Loops
- Explored core data structures: lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Mastered looping constructs (`for` and `while`) to iterate over sequences and perform repetitive tasks.
- Wrote and called custom functions to organize code and promote reusability.

## Week 9: File I/O and Practical Application
- Learned to read from and write to text files to persist data.
- Implemented error handling using `try-except` blocks to build more robust programs.
- Developed a simple command-line application to solidify understanding of Python concepts learned so far.

## Conclusion
- This 9-week App Academy course provided a comprehensive journey from foundational web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to backend programming with Python.
- The curriculum was project-based, allowing for practical application of learned concepts in real-world scenarios like the Pine City Zoo, Calculator, and Contact Book applications.
- Successfully completed all modules, gaining proficiency in both front-end and introductory back-end development.
